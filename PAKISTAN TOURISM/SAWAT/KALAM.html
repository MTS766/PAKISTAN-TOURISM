    <p><blockquote>Kalam (Kalami, Pashto, & Urdu: کالام) is a valley located 99 kilometres (62 mi) from Mingora in the northern upper section of Swat valley along the banks of the Swat River in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The Swat River was formed as a result of the confluence of two major tributaries, the Gabral and Ushu river.

        At an elevation about 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level, the valley itself provides a plateau that is located above the river and is used for farming.There are a number of visible mountains, also visible from Matiltan, a valley close to Kalam Valley, including Mount Falaksar 5,918 meters (19,416 feet), and another unnamed peak 6,096 meters (20,000 feet) high.</blockquote></p>
