    <p><blockquote>Hanna Lake is in the hills close to where the Urak Valley begins, 17 kilometres (11 mi) east from Quetta city.[2] The reservoir was constructed in 1894 during the British Colonial era on the land of local tribesmen, and is one of the main attractions in the city. It forms a great historical bridge wall between two mountains, the depths like battlements of a fort, for the storing of water.</blockquote></p>
