    <p><blockquote>Gwadar Bay (Urdu: خلیج گوادر) is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran. The name is from Persian, Khalij-e Gavader or "Gulf of Gwadar" on the Arabian Sea. It is an inlet of the Arabian Sea indenting the sandy Makran coast at the Iran–Pakistan border. It is about 30 kilometres (20 mi) long and 16 kilometres (10 mi) wide. The Dashtiari River flows into it from the northwest, and the Dasht River from the northeast. The town of Jiwani is located on the eastern end of the Gwadar Bay. The port city of Gwadar lies about 50 kilometres (30 mi) to the east, while the sister port city of Chabahar is located about 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the west of the Gwadar Bay.</blockquote></p>
